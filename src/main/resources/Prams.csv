We've included everything your little one will need to stay snug and stylish on their journey from newborn to toddler, including a pram liner and apron, cosytoe with soft lining, a hood for both the carrycot and pushchair, and a full-coverage weathershield that can be used in all modes. The coordinating carrycot attaches to the chassis to form a pram with lie-flat mode for newborns, or you can use the included adaptors to create a travel system (car seat sold separately). The seat unit can be used in the forward-facing or parent-facing position, allowing you to show your baby off to the world or save their smiles for yourself. We recommend using the pushchair with the carrycot from birth until six months to support your baby's spinal development, before switching to seat mode. The separate carrycot with padded mattress allows your newborn to lie completely flat, which aids healthy development. With a soft jersey lining and ventilation panel on the hood, the luxurious carrycot provides the perfect environment for baby's first outings. ",Edit Pram And Pushchair - Midnight Black,1,1,NULL,11.4,58
